# Encoding Shelves

To visualize data, analysts can drag-and-drop a data field onto an encoding channel shelf \(e.g., x, y, color\). By default, the system encodes raw \(unaggregated\) values. Via a drop-down menu, analysts can select a transformation such as an aggregation, binning, or time unit function.
