# Wildcard Function

![Wildcard Function](../../.gitbook/assets/wildcardfunction.PNG)

Wildcard functions allow simultaneous specification of data field transformations. Checking the wildcard checkbox in an encoding shelf’s drop-down menu enables a wildcard function. Once enabled, the radio buttons for each function become check-boxes, allowing analysts to select which functions to include. For example, selecting none and mean produces charts with raw data and mean summaries, as shown in Figure 5-D. The encoding shelf capsule denotes the use of wildcard functions with “?”.
