# Wildcard Fields

Wildcard fields let you create multiple views in parallel by enumerating over a set of fields. Quantitative, Categorical, and Temporal field wildcards are provided by default, though you can manually author custom wildcards containing the desired fields.

To create a wildcard for a specific set of fields, analysts can author a custom wildcard field by dragging desired fields to the wildcard list. To avoid incongruous views, Voyager prevents analysts from creating custom wildcard fields containing multiple data types. For more details, visit the [Custom Wildcard Fields ](custom-wildcard-fields.md)page.
