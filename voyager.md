# Introduction

## Project Goals

Voyager 2 is a new mixed-initiative tool that blends manual and automatic chart specification in a unified system. It aims to support smoother gradations between open-ended and more focused phases of analysis. It is a powerful tool that augments traditional visual analysis interfaces with two new partial view specification techniques. Features like wildcards, can allow analysts to precisely vary the properties of a specification to generate multiple charts in parallel, giving them control over sets of views aligned with their analysis goals. Similarly, related views features can automatically recommend charts based on the current user-specified focus view, in which promote the discovery of relevant data fields and alternative ways to summarize or encode the data.

## Interface Overview

TODO: show image with annotations

TODO: List different parts (and links to "actions" that they can do)

- For top-panel, just describe in a sentence what it has
- Bookmark - move to end -- your top-panel text can say there is a button for opening bookmark gallery (link)
- Data -- select dataset (link)
- Encoding - for
