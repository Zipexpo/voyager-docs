# Bookmark Gallery

Bookmarked visualizations can be viewed in the bookmark gallery. Once a visualization has been bookmarked, a pop-up of the visualization will appear along with previously bookmarked visualizations.

 Users can add and edit their notes for bookmarked visualizations from within this panel. They can also use the clear all button to delete all bookmarks and export the Vega-Lite specs for all bookmarked visualizations by using the export all button.
