# Bookmark Gallery

Bookmarked visualizations can be viewed in the bookmark gallery. Once a visualization has been bookmarked, a pop-up of the visualization will appear along with previously bookmarked visualizations.

You can add and edit notes for bookmarked visualizations from within this panel. You can also use the export all button to export Vega-Lite specs for all bookmarked visualizations or click the clear all button to delete all bookmarks.
